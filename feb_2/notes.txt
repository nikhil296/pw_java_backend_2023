length vs length()
    - length : it is a property of Array type classs in java. it is not a method.
    - length() : it is method of String class that calculates the length of string.

Anonymous array :
    - An array without a name is called a Anonymous array.
    - This type of array is created just for instance use.
    - eg :
        int add(int a[]) {
            // ... logic
        }
        main() {
             // below we passed an array that has no name, hence anonymous array.
            int result = add( new int[]{10, 20, 30, 40} );
        }
    - Usage of Anonymous array internally by JVM :-

        public class Demo{
            public static void main(String []args){
                System.out.println("Working with array");
            }
        }

        javac Demo.java
        java Demo 10 20 => Demo.main(new String[]{"10","20});   // size 2 anonymous aray is created.
        java Demo => Demo.main(new String[]{});                 // size 0 anonymous aray is created.
        java Demo 10 => Demo.main(new String[]{"10"});          // size 1 anonymous aray is created.
        java Demo sachin tendulkar => Demo.main(new String[]{"sachin","tendulkar"});

Can you make an array volatile?
    - You can only make variables pointing to an array volatile. 
        If an array is changed by replacing individual elements, 
        then guarantees provided by volatile variable will not be held.

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException :-
    - If we try to access the index which is not in the array range then it would result in an
        Exception called “ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException”.
        eg :-
            public class Demo{
                public static void main(String []args){
                    int[] a = {10,20,30,40,50}
                    for(int i =0;i<=5;i++)
                        System.out.println(a[i]);
                }
            }
          Output
            10
            20
            ?0
            40
            50
            Exception in Thread main java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException

Diadvantage of Array
    - once we create the size cannot be increased or decreased
    - It stores only homogeneous data elements.
