1. What is Statically and Dynamically typed programming language ?
    - Statically typed language : Programming languages are referred to as "Static typed" if the
            memory of the variable is provided at the time of compilation.
            eg :- Java, C, C++.
            here we actually tell the compiler, a memory has to be allocated for a variable
            of specified data type. By doing this we restrict the memory to accept data of 
            specified type only.
    - Dynamically typed language : Programming languages are said to as "Dynamically typed"
            if the memory for the variable is provided at the time of execution.
            eg :- Javascript, Python, PHP.

2. What is the variable in java ?
    - varables in java are actually titles/names given to a memory location(which act as a container 
        that holds any value). these act as pointers to those memory location where we 
        store data of any type.

3. How to assign a value to a variable ?
    - we can assign value to variable either in the declaration itself or seperately after the declaration
        syntax : " Data_type variableName = [value]; "
        eg :- 1. String name = "Nikhil"; // during declaration.
              2. int x;
                 x = 10; // seperately after declaration.

4. What are Primitive data types in java ?
    - the predefined data types are primitive data types.
    there are 8 primitive data types in java, they are.
    (boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float, double)

5. what are Identifiers in java ?
    - Identifier is a name given to (class, package, interface, vaiable, or methods) in a java program.

6. List the Operators in java ?
    - 1. Arithmetic Operators
      2. Relational/Comparison Operators
      3. Logical Operators
      4. Assignment Operators
      5. Bitwise Operators
7. Explain about increment and decrement Operators with example ?
    - Increment and Decrement Operators are unary arithmetic Operators, that is they only need 1 operand.
        they are of 2 types - ( post(value used 1st then operation done) & 
                                pre(operation done first then value used) )
        eg :-  int x = 10;
                1. post-increment : 
                        { System.out.println(x++); // first 10 is printed then value of x becomes 11 }
                2. pre-increment :
                        { System.out.println(++x); // first value of x is incremented to 11 then 11
                             is printed then }
                3. post-decrement :
                        { System.out.println(x++); // first 10 is printed then value of x becomes 9 }
                4. pre-decrement :
                        { System.out.println(++x); // first value of x is decremented to 9 then 9
                             is printed }
