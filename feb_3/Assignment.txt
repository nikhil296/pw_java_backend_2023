1. What is a String in java ?
    - String in java is a class that is present in the "java.lang" package.
    Stringsare treated as Objects in java and is thus strored in Heap area of JVM.

2. Types of String in java ?
    - There are 2 types of strings in java :
        1. Immutable Strings.
        2. Mutable Strings.

3. In how many ways can u create Sting Objects in java ?
    - There are 3 ways to create String Objects in java
        1. String literal : eg - String name = "nikhil";
        2. using "new" keyword : eg - String name = new String("nikhil");
        3. using "intern()" method : eg - String name = new String("nikhil").intern();

4. What is a String constant pool ?
    - String Pool in Java is a special storage space in Java Heap memory where string literals are stored.
        It is also known by the names - "String Constant Pool" or "String Intern Pool". 
        Whenever a string literal is created, the JVM first checks the String Constant Pool 
        before creating a new String object corresponding to it.

5. What do you mean by mutable and immutable objects ?
    - Mutable : objects that can be modified.
      Immutable : objects that can't be modified, whenever we try to modify or change its
                    value, a new copy with the changed value is created and objects reference
                    is changed to this new memory space holding the changed/modified value. 
                    the old memory storing the old value is dereferenced.

6. Where exactly is the string constant pool located in the memory ?
    - The String constant poll is a special storage space located in the heap Memory of JVM
        architecture.
