Git Architecture :-
    . There are 3 stages involved, 
    . "git init" command creates these stages in ur workspace.
        - Working Area : every code we write and save is in this area.
        - Staging Area : "git add " command adds the saves files into the staging area.
        - Local Repository : "git commit " commits the files from staging area to local repo.
    
    . "git push" pushes the code to the remote repo.
    . "git pull" puls remote repo changes and adds it to ur local working area.
