1. What do you mean by an Array ?
    - An array in java is a collection of fixed number of homogenious elements stored 
        in a continious memory. java arrays are actually objects hence craeted in heap memory.

2. How to create an Array ?
    -  There are 2 ways to create an array in java.
        1. using new => int a[] = new int[5];
        2. initializing and declaring at same time => int a[] = {10, 20, 30, 40};

3. Can we change the size of an array at run time ?
    - no we cannot change the size of array at run time in java.

4. Can you declare an array without assigning size of an array ?
    - No we can't declare an array without its size, if we do so we have to initialize it in 
        the same line otherwise it will throw compile time error.

5. What is the default value of Array ?

6. What is a 1D array with an exampple ?
    - a 1d array is simple array of elements.
        eg :- int a[] = {10, 20, 30, 40};

7. Write a program on a 2D array ?
    - a 2d array is array of array references and each reference represents a 1d array of elements.
        eg :- int b[][] = {{1,2, 3}, {10, 20, 30}, {5, 6}};
