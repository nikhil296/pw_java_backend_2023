Question : If StringBuffer length is doubled by creating new object when max capacity is exceeded
            then, we know a "final" StringBuffer object cannot refer to different
            object and it will give compilation error when try to do that.
            So, why if we try to increase a final StringBuffer beyond the max capacity
            still it does not give any error even though a new object is created with double capacity
            and the same final StringBuffer object is now pointing to thi different object ??

Mutable Strings :-
    - Once if we create a String, on that String if we try to perform any operation and if those 
        changes get reflected in the same object then such strings are called â€œMutable Strings".
        eg : StringBuffer, StringBuilder
