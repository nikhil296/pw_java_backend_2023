Ways to Compare :-
    1. "==" : compares the references of the string object.
    2. "equals()" : compares the content of the String object.

'+'   vs   concat() :-
    1. '+' : does not allocates memory outside SCP unless reference to string objects is used.
        . eg :- String s1 = "sachin";  // in SCP
                String s2 = " Nikhil"  // in SCP
                String s3 = s1 + s2;   // in heap outside SCP, but a copy is also created in SCP.
                                       // since reference to s1 and s2 were used.
                String s4 = "Nikhil" + "Gautam" + "is";   // in SCP
    
    2. concat() : inbuilt method so allocates memory outside SCP in Heap.
        . eg :- String s1 = "pw";                   // in SCP.
                String s2 = s1.concat(" skill");    // in Heap outside SCP, a copy in SCP too.
                s1.concat(" classes");              // in Heap outside SCP, but it is not referenced
                                                    // also a copy is made in SCP too.
                String s3 = new String("Hey ");     // in Heap outside SCP. copy in SCP.
                s3 = s3.concat("Nikhil");           // in Heap outside SCP, S3 points to this object
                                                    // copy in SCP. older s3 value remains dereferenced.

Inbuilt String Methods :-
    . Any inbuilt methods when used will allocate memory for the string object in Heap outside SCP.
        1. public char charAt(int index)    
            - index can't be -ve or more than length of string.
            - StringArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
        2. public String concat(String str)
        3. public boolean equals(Object o)
            - It is used for Content Comparison, 
            - In String class equals() method is Overridden to check the 
            content of the object. It is used for Content Comparison without comparing the case.
        4. public String subString(int begin)
        5. public String subString(int begin,int end)
        6. public int length()
        7. public String replace(char old, char new)
        8. public String toLowerCase()
        9. public String toUpperCase()
            - eg:   String s1 = "HEY";                     // in SCP
                    String s2 = "hey".toUpperCase();       // in Heap outside SCP.
                    (s1 == s2)  => "false"                 // since references are being checked.
                    (s1.equals(s2))  => "true"             // since contents are being checked.
        10. public String trim()
        11. public int indexOf(char ch)
            - returns (-1) if char not present.
        12. public int lastIndexOf(char ch)
            - returns (-1) if char not present.
