1. What are the conditionl operators in java ?
    - there are 3 conditional operators in java.
        1. Logical AND (&&) : it returns true if all the boolean expression are true. 
                    it stops checking expressions further once we encounter a "false" expression.
        2. Logical OR (||) : it returns true if atleast one of the boolean expression is true.
                    it stops checking expressions further once we encounter a "true" value.
        3. Ternary Operator (?:) : it is short-hand or smaller version of if-else statement.
                    if condition is true, statement-1 is executed else statement-2 is executed.

2. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands ?
    - 3 types of operators based on number of operands;
        1. unary operator : that acts on one operand. eg : {unary increment/decrement operator}
        2. binary operator : that acts upon 2 operands. eg : { Arithmetic operators like +, -, *, /, %}
        3. Conditional/Ternary operator : that uses 3 operand.
                eg. (condition) ? statement-1 : statement-2;
                1st operand is condition itself, the condition is converted to boolean.
                if condition is true--> statement-1 is executed otherwise--> statement-2 is executed.
                statement-1 & statement-2 are other 2 operands.
                
3. Use of switch case in Java ?
    - we use switch case when we want to do multiple operations based on the value of a variable.
        in such a situation using switch-case is much more efficient that using if-else-if ladder.
        switch-case works with - { int, long, byte, short, enum types, Strings, and 
            with wrapper classes as well }

4. what is the priority levels of arithmetic operations in java ?
    - The priority levels of arithmetic operators in java is as follows (*, /, %) >> (+, -).

5. What are the conditional statements and use of conditional statements in java ?
    - 3 conditional statements are there in java,
        1. if-else statement.
        2. switch statement.
        3. Ternary Operator.

6. What is the syntax of if-else statement ?
    - if(condition) {
        // if condition holds true below lines are executed. 
        // if condition = false we fall into else block.
        // executable lines.
      } else {
        // executable lines.
      }
      we can add more condition to else statement and make "if-elseif-else" ladder.

7. what is the three types of iterative statements on java ?
    - The 3 types of iterative statements are :-
        1. while
        2. do-while
        3. for
        4. there is an additional type called - "for each".

8. write the difference between for loop and do-while loop ?
    - for-loop : in this type of loop statement we check the condition first and then any line 
                    inside the loop bock is executed.
      do-while loop : in this type of loop statement atleast once the loop block statements are 
                        executed before we check if the condition holds true or not.

9. write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 .
    - class Print {
        public static void main (String args[]) {
            for(int i = 1; i<=10; i++) {
                System.out.print(i+" ");
            }
        }
    }
