1. What is programming language ?
    - a language understood by the public or user using which we provide a set of instructions
        to the processor/computer to perform a specific task.
2. Why do we need a programming language ?
    - to make any computer perform any task we need to provide set of instructions.
        now a computer/processor only understands low voltage(0) or high voltage(1).
        since it is difficult to give complex instructions directly in form of volatges
        hence, the need of programming language.
3. Features of java ?
    - 1. Robust 2. platform independent 3. object oriented 4. Simple 5. distributed
        6. Dynamic 7. portable.
4. What is an object ?
    - Object is an independent entity of a class created using the class blueprint.
     every object has the properties and behaviourof its class.
5. What is a class ?
    - A class is a collection of objects with similar traits, behaviour and attributes.
        it is the blueprint from which the independent objects are created.
6. Explain main() method in java ?
    - possible syntax :-
        "public static void main(String args[]) {...}"
        "public static void main(String... args) {...}"
    - the "public" and "static" keywords can be interchanged.
    - the main method is where execution of a java program starts.
    - keywords involved;
        - main : name of method. it cannot be changed. ie. nikhilMain() is wrong as 
                JVM always looks for "main()" method.   
        - void : return type. main method does not return anything.
        - static : can be called/invoked without creating the object of a class.
                    ie. { "clasname".main() }
        - public : for visibility.
        - String args[] : the commandline arguments as a array of strings.
    - JVM always looks for above metioned 4-5 attributes in main method. 
        if any of them is missing then it gives an error.
